## About Phở Cồ Việt

Phở Cồ Việt is more than a website—it’s a mission born in Thạch Bi, Nam Định, just 4.5 km from the legendary Phở Cồ village of Đồng Sơn. I’m Dang Hoang, a Vietnamese IT engineer in Japan, driven by a dream to share the authentic taste of Nam Định Pho with the world. From my family’s Pho shop in Hải Phòng (2011-2012) to Thạch Bi (2013-present, now run by my sister and brother-in-law), Pho has been my bridge between heritage and innovation.

Here, we’re building "Phở Cồ Việt"—a digital hub to document my journey crafting the perfect Pho noodle in Japan, starting with experiments like [First Noodle Test](https://phocoviet.com/first-noodle-test). It’s about preserving tradition, uplifting my hometown, and blending technology with culinary passion. Tokyo 2028 is our launch goal—join me on this flavorful ride!

## Core Technology

Phở Cồ Việt is powered by modern web tech to deliver a fast, beautiful, and scalable experience:

- **Next.js 14.0+**: Server-side rendering and static site generation for blazing-fast performance and SEO.  
- **TypeScript 5.0+**: Type safety for robust, maintainable code.  
- **Tailwind CSS 3.0+**: Utility-first styling for a sleek, responsive design.  
- **Vercel Deployment**: Seamless hosting and scaling with Next.js’s home platform.  
- **MDX**: Rich blog content with Markdown + JSX for dynamic storytelling.  

This stack reflects my IT roots—precision and efficiency meet the warmth of Pho.
